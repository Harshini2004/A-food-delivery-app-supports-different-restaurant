# A-food-delivery-app-supports-different-restaurant
This project models a restaurant billing system used by a food delivery app. The app supports different restaurant types:
                      Fast Food
                      Fine Dining 
                      Buffet
Each restaurant calculates the total bill differently (e.g., includes tax, service charges, or fixed pricing).
Goals:
  All restaurant types should have a method to calculate the bill.
  Easily support new restaurant types without modifying existing code.
  Ensure the system works even without knowing the restaurant type in advance.
  Follow OOP principles â€” especially Abstraction, Polymorphism, and Open/Closed Principle.
